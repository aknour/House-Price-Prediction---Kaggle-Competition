## Overview
This project is an in-depth analysis and predictive modeling of house prices. Using a comprehensive dataset provided by Kaggle, the goal was to predict house sale prices based on a variety of features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling and data preprocessing

## Key Processes
1. **Data Exploration & Preliminary Analysis:** Explored the dataset to understand the underlying patterns, relationships, and structures.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, standardized numerical features, and encoded categorical variables.
3. **Feature Engineering & Selection:** Enhanced the dataset by creating new features and selected the most impactful ones using correlation analysis.
4. **Modeling:** Established a baseline model using RandomForestRegressor. Later, optimized using Ridge Regression to achieve better predictions.
5. **Evaluation:** Employed metrics such as RMSE and R^2 to gauge model performance on unseen data.

## Results
The Ridge Regression model showcased impressive predictive capabilities. The top features influencing the house prices were identified, providing valuable insights into the housing market dynamics.
